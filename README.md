1.  CPP: Complete the function solveMeFirst to compute the sum of two integers. [solution](1.cpp)

2.  CPP: Given an array of integers, find the sum of its elements.  [solution](2.cpp)

3.  CPP: Calculate and print the sum of the elements in an array, keeping in mind that some of those integers may be quite large.   [solution](3.cpp)

4.  JAVASCRIPT: Implement a function named factorial that has one parameter: an integer, n. It must return the value of n! (i.e., n factorial). [solution](4.js)

5.  JAVASCRIPT: Declare a constant variable,PI, and assign it the value Math.PI. You will not pass this challenge unless the variable is declared as a constant and named PI (uppercase).
Read a number,R , denoting the radius of a circle from stdin.
Use PI and r to calculate the area and perimeter of a circle having radius .
Print area as the first line of output and print perimeter as the second line of output.    [solution](5.js)

6.  JAVASCRIPT: Complete the vowelsAndConsonants function in the editor below. It has one parameter, a string,s , consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e., a through z). The function must do the following:
First, print each vowel in s on a new line. The English vowels are a, e, i, o, and u, and each vowel must be printed in the same order as it appeared in s.Second, print each consonant (i.e., non-vowel) in s on a new line in the same order as it appeared in s. [solution](6.js)

7.  CPP: Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.    [solution](7.cpp)

8.  CPP: Given an array of integers, calculate the fractions of its elements that are positive, negative, and are zeros. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line.    [solution](8.cpp)

9.  CPP: Write a program that prints a staircase of size n.    [solution](9.cpp)
For eg. n=5 <br />
        \* <br />
       \*\* <br />
      \*\*\* <br />
     \*\*\*\* <br />
    \*\*\*\*\* <br />

10. CPP: Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.   [solution](10.cpp)

11. CPP: Given an integer,n , print its first 10 multiples. Each multiple nxi (where 1<=i<=10) should be printed on a new line in the form: n x i = result.    [solution](11.cpp)

12. CPP: Given a string,s, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line.      [solution](12.cpp)
For eg.
INPUT                       OUTPUT
2                           Hce akr
Hacker                      Rn ak
Rank

13. JAVASCRIPT: Complete the getSecondLargest function in the editor below. It has one parameter: an array,nums , of n numbers. The function must find and return the second largest number in nums.    [solution](13.js)

14. JAVASCRIPT: Complete the reverseString function; it has one parameter, s . You must perform the following actions:
Try to reverse string s using the split, reverse, and join methods.
If an exception is thrown, catch it and print the contents of the exception's message on a new line.
Print s on a new line. If no exception was thrown, then this should be the reversed string; if an exception was thrown, this should be the original string.     [solution](14.js)

15. CPP: Breaking The Record- 
Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a record of her play. She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for most points and least points in a game. Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.     [solution](15.cpp)

16. CPP: Given an array,A, of n integers, print A's elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.  [solution](16.cpp)

17. CPP: Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.
Note: Midnight is 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock, and 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock. Noon is 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock, and 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.       [solution](17.cpp)

18. CPP: Insertion Sort with each pass being printed.       [solution](18.cpp)
